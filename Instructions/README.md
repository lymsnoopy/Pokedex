# Final Project Instructions

Below lists the high level overview for your final project. You will want to review each expectation in more detail in the linked documents.

## Overview

For this final project, you will be working in a team (your Team Activity groups) to build an application that focuses on collecting information about products, building lists, and sharing that information with others. You will have a lot of freedom on what you pick for the "product", such as it could be you are tracking board game collections, products in a book store, or maybe fish in multiple aquariums.

### Your Team
Your team is a group hired by company "Collections Incorporated" to prototype new products for them. Your TA is the production manager for your team, so will act as a resource and sounding board throughout this process. Your instructor, the division manager incase there are any issues, and will be evaluating the final product produced by your team. To simulate this environment, there will be a number of assessment points, that include both individual and team components being graded. In the end, you will have a mini-program you will be able to demonstrate. 


## Your Application
For  guidelines on what you are building, see [product expectations](ProductExpectations.md). 

## Project Graded Components

To break up the project (and this document) into manageable parts, there will be multiple graded components. Each component has their own README.md file (linked below), that will provide more details on expectations. To keep due dates contained to canvas, each component will have a due date listed in canvas. In general, major turn in dates for this four week project are

* Week 2 - Product Proposal
* Week 4 - Product Presentation/Demonstration
* Week 4/5 - Submission due, along with retrospective. 

### Individual Components

* [Product Proposal](ProductProposal.md) - As a team, you will be presenting your initial design, timeline, a small prototype, and a plan for the final project to your product manager (TA). This will ideally happen at your weekly team meeting, but if the TA can't make that time, you will have to arrange another time that fits everyone's schedules for that week.  
    * Group Points - 4 points 
    * Individual Points - 2 points
* [Demonstration](ProductDemonstration.md) - Each team member will be responsible for demonstrating a part of the final application to the product manager (TA). This will be done in the last week of class, and will be a live demonstration of the product, and will be done in a group meeting or another arranged time. 
    * Group Points - 8 points 
    * Individual Points - 4 points
* [Final Product](ProductExpectations.md) - This will be a review of your final product stored in the team github repo. It will encompass reviewing the code, the tests, and full documentation against the final course outcomes. 
  * Group Points - 24 points
* [Final Retrospective](ProductRetrospective.md) - This will be a review of the project, and how it went. It will be a reflection on what went well, what didn't, and what you would do differently next time. It will also include a component in which you are evaluated on your contribution to the product  by your team members, by your product manager, and by various measures we can generate to help determine your individual contribution to the overall project (git check-ins vs check-in lengths, etc). 
  * Individual Points - 8 points

Total Group Points: **36**  
Total Individual Points: **14**
 
Total points for your final project: **50**


## Submission Guidelines

Each component will have an assignment associated with it on canvas to make final due dates clear. However, only the final retrospective will be submitted individually. The rest of the components will be graded by either looking at your final github repository or by attending the presentation/demonstration.

This project tests everything you learned in this course, while also adding the element of group work. We highly encourage you to make use of Github tools to help developers work together, such as issues and pull requests. It is worth noting the motivation for this project came from past students and TAs, who reported when going to their first internship, a group project using github like this would have been helpful. As such, every effort has been made to make this project an opportunity to help prepare you for your first internships.
