# Final Project Retrospective

Being able to reflect and provide individual feedback on projects is an essential skill. Often in industry, you will be asked to reflect on your work (often tied to the merit review process), and provide feedback on your peers. This is a chance to practice that skill.


## Expectations
You will write a one (1) page reflection that should include the following components:

* What went well in the project?
* What didn't go well in the project?
* What would you do differently next time?
* What did you learn from the project? - Highly major things you learned, and how you can apply them in the future. Not just 'I learned who to write a loop'. 
* What did you contribute to the project? 
* What are some things you can improve on in the future/how will you improve on them (this can be related to the project or not)?

You SHOULD NOT just bullet point your answers! This needs to be well thought out prose!


Additionally, you should include a separate paragraph/point on each of your team members. The paragraph should include:

* Team Member Name, and their role in the project. What was one thing you learned from them. Rating (between 0-4) of their contribution to the project. 

The last part is always hard to do. It is important to remember that this is a learning experience, and that rating yourself and others is something that happens in a work environment. We will only be using the rating very lightly as we evaluate other metrics towards individual contribution. 


## Grading

The grading for this assignment will be based on the following criteria:

Part 1: Self Retrospective 
* 4 points - All components are well thought out and covered. The reflection is clear and concise. It is possible to determine what you learned and contributed from this project.
* 3 points - All components are covered, but not well thought out. The reflection is clear, but not concise. It is possible to determine what you learned or contributed from this project.
* 2 points - Some components are missing, and the reflection is not clear. It is difficult to determine what you learned or contributed from this project. If you bullet point your answers, this is the max score you can get!
* 1 point - Most components are missing, and the reflection is not clear. It is not possible to determine what you learned or contributed from this project.

Part 2: Contribution to Project
* negative to 4 points - this will be evaluated on a combination of factors including: your retrospective, your team mates retrospectives, git check-ins, git changes (check-in relative to the team and code base size), participation in meetings, and other factors.  As every category contributes, a 4 would mean someone is equally and fully participating in the project, where a 1 would mean minimum participation (attended meetings maybe). Most people will probably be between 1-4, closer to 3 or 4.

It is worth noting - if you never participated, we may assign a negative in this category due to how canvas handles group grading. It allows us to remove your group score, as you shouldn't receive a group grade if you don't participate. This will be a really rare case, but it is worth noting in case it happens.
