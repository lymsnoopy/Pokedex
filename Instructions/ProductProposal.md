# Project Proposal


Your internship team having spent time talking about your goals and plans, now is being asked to proposal the application to the product manager. Your manager is an experienced developer who plans to give you feedback on your proposal, and help you refine your ideas. Since they are an experienced developer, they expect the conversation to be in depth, and will be asking questions about your design, your timeline, and your plans for the final project.


## Proposal Expectations
The proposal does not have to be a formal presentation. Though if that helps the team keep their thoughts organized, that is fine. Every team member should be present to talk about the proposal. The proposal should include the following:

* What are you building?
* What are the initial features for the application?
* What are the *minimum* additional features you plan to implement?
* What are your stretch goals (features beyond the minimum)?
* Go over your initial design.
  * Special emphasis should be placed on how you plan to break it up 
  * MVC, presenter, file management, different input validation, testing, documentation, etc. 
* How do you plan to break up the work?
* What is your teams timeline and major check-in points?


### Deliverables 

Most of the information you are presented needs to be documented as a deliverable. This could be a powerpoint, a word document, or even a markdown file in your repository (use the DesignDocuments directory). The key is that it is a living document that can be updated as you learn more about your project. 

You should also have an **Initial** UML diagram to present. It will still be pretty sparse, and that is fine. However, it should be enough where team members have an idea of which part they are expanding on and working on. 


### Grading

The grading for this assignment will be based on the following criteria:

#### Group Grade
* 4 points - Proposal is well thought out and covers all the major points. Documentation is clear. 
* 3 points - Proposal is missing some key points, but is well thought out. Documentation exists, but not clear.
* 2 points - Proposal is missing some key points and missing documentation. 
* 1 point - Proposal is missing key points, documentation is missing or not clear, there isn't a plan going into the proposal.


#### Individual Grade
* 2 points - Student is present and contributes to the proposal, their camera is on (unless they have a good reason for it not to be), and they are able to answer questions about the proposal.
* 1 point - Student attends the meeting.
